Our raytracer makes use of the libPNG library to write the output image. 
The computers in 349 Soda have libPNG installed but some of the other lab computers don't.
Please run this on a computer with libPNG installed.

Also our writeImage() function in main.cpp borrows heavily from the example provided here: 
http://www.labbookpages.co.uk/software/imgProc/libPNG.html

image-013.obj was taken from: http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs184/fa09/resources.php

image-012.obj was taken from: http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/obj/obj.html


NOTE: Please see the Outputs/ folder to see examples of what our raytracer can do.
The outputs can be regereated with the corresponding with the corresponding file in the Inputs/ folder.
Check out "image-005", "image-011", and "image-012" in particular!
