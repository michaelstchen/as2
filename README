Our raytracer makes use of the libPNG library to write the output image. The computers in 349 Soda have libPNG installed but some of the other lab computers don't. Please run this on a computer with libPNG installed.

Also our writeImage() function in main.cpp borrows heavily from the example provided here: http://www.labbookpages.co.uk/software/imgProc/libPNG.html

image-013.obj was taken from: http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs184/fa09/resources.php

image-012.obj was taken from: http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/obj/obj.html

All required features are implemented. No optional features have been implemented.
